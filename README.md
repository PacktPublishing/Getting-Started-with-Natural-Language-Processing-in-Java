# Getting Started with Natural Language Processing in Java [Video]
This is the code repository for [Getting Started with Natural Language Processing in Java [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/getting-started-natural-language-processing-java-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788474191), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used in many applications to provide capabilities that were previously not possible. It involves analyzing text to obtain the intent and meaning, which can then be used to support an application. Using NLP within an application requires a combination of standard Java techniques and often specialized libraries frequently based on models that have been trained. You need to know what is available, how these technologies can be used, and when they should be used. In this course we will cover the essence of NLP using Java. This video course will commence by walking you through basic NLP tasks including data acquisition, data cleaning, finding parts of text, and determining the end of sentences. These serve as the basis for other NLP tasks such as classifying text and determining the relationship between text elements. This will be followed by the use of tokenization techniques. Tokenization is used for almost all NLP tasks. You will learn how text can be split to reveal information such as names, dates, and even the grammatical structure of a sentence. These types of activity can lead to insights into the relationships between text elements and embedded meaning in a document. Upon completion of this course, you will be ready to take on more advanced NLP tasks.
